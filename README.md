- 👋 Hi, I’m @cubiclephobic
- 👀 I’m interested in fixing what's broken and since I haven't learned to code, I am a happy tester, troubleshooter, feedbacker, ideator, observer, or just learner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be nice.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your next beta or bug fix.
- 📫 How to reach me right here, precious. Xoxo
